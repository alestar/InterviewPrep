Practice Bugfix Question
0:31:20
There is a bug in one line of the code. Find it, fix it, and submit.
Given a sorted array of integers a, your task is to determine which element of a is closest to all other values of a. In other words, find the element x in a, which minimizes the following sum:

abs(a[0] - x) + abs(a[1] - x) + ... + abs(a[a.length - 1] - x)
(where abs denotes the absolute value)

If there are several possible answers, output the smallest one.

Example

For a = [2, 4, 7], the output should be solution(a) = 4.

for x = 2, the value will be abs(2 - 2) + abs(4 - 2) + abs(7 - 2) = 7.
for x = 4, the value will be abs(2 - 4) + abs(4 - 4) + abs(7 - 4) = 5.
for x = 7, the value will be abs(2 - 7) + abs(4 - 7) + abs(7 - 7) = 8.
The lowest possible value is when x = 4, so the answer is 4.

For a = [2, 3], the output should be solution(a) = 2.

for x = 2, the value will be abs(2 - 2) + abs(3 - 2) = 1.
for x = 3, the value will be abs(2 - 3) + abs(3 - 3) = 1.
Because there is a tie, the smallest x between x = 2 and x = 3 is the answer.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[memory limit] 1 GB

[input] array.integer a

A non-empty array of integers, sorted in ascending order.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ a.length ≤ 1000,
-106 ≤ a[i] ≤ 106.

[output] integer

An integer representing the element from a that minimizes the sum of its absolute differences with all other elements.

# Example usage:
a1 = [2, 4, 7]
print(solution(a1))  # Output: 4
a2 = [2, 3]
print(solution(a2))  # Output: 2
a3 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(solution(a3))  # Output: 2 (lower median)
a4 = [5]
print(solution(a4))  # Output: 5
