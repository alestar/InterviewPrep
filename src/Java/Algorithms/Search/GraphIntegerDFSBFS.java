/**
 * Depth-first search (DFS) is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a DFS,
 * you go as deep as possible down one path before backing up and trying a different one.
 *
 * Depth-first search is like walking through a corn maze. You explore one path, hit a dead end, and go back and try a different one.
 *
 * Here's a how a DFS would traverse this tree, starting with the root.
 *
 * We'd go down the first path we find until we hit a dead end.
 *
 * Then we'd do the same thing againâ€”go down a path until we hit a dead end. And again, and again, and again.
 *
 * Until we reach the end.
 *
 * Depth-first search is often compared with breadth-first search.
 *
 * Advantages:
 *      Depth-first search on a binary tree generally requires less memory than breadth-first.
 *      Depth-first search can be easily implemented with recursion.
 *  Disadvantages:
 *      A DFS doesn't necessarily find the shortest path to a node, while breadth-first search does.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Breadth-first search (BFS) is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a BFS, you first explore all the nodes one step away,
 * then all the nodes two steps away, etc.
 *
 * Breadth-first search is like throwing a stone in the center of a pond. The nodes you explore "ripple out" from the starting point.
 *
 * Here's a how a BFS would traverse this tree, starting with the root.
 *
 * We'd visit all the immediate children (all the nodes that're one step away from our starting node).
 *
 * Then we'd move on to all those nodes' children (all the nodes that're two steps away from our starting node).
 *
 * And so on. Until we reach the end.
 *
 *Breadth-first search is often compared with depth-first search.
 *
 * Advantages:
 *   A BFS will find the shortest path between the starting point and any other reachable node.
 *   A depth-first search will not necessarily find the shortest path.
 * Disadvantages:
 *   A BFS on a binary tree generally requires more memory than a DFS.
